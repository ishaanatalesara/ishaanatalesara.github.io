                <p>Job loss is one of the most costly economic risks workers face, but a firm’s layoff risk is difficult to observe. We document substantial, persistent variation in firm layoff rates, creating scope for workers to change their job loss risk through firm choice. We exploit linked survey, experimental, and administrative data from Austria to examine how unemployed workers perceive and respond to information about firm-level layoff risk. Workers believe that past layoffs are predictive of future risk and prefer jobs at firms with lower historical layoff rates, but have significant misperceptions about which firms are safer. Providing workers with information about firm layoff histories causes them to redirect their search toward historically safer employers. Using a search and matching model, we show that imperfect information distorts equilibrium outcomes: it reverses the compensating differential for layoff risk and raises the average layoff rate by allocating more workers to high-risk firms.</p>

                <p>How important are social norms in shaping women’s labor supply relative to neo-classical economic forces? The widely studied "breadwinner norm" holds that it is socially undesirable for married women to earn more than their husbands. We test this prediction using an experiment in India. We randomly vary wage offers for salaried jobs among married women. If the norm binds, labor supply should be discontinuous or flatten when women are offered wages above their husbands' income. We find no evidence that women withdraw from the labor force when offered wages that exceed their husbands’ incomes and can reject negative discontinuities as small as 1.5 percentage points. Instead, labor supply is highly responsive to wages, consistent with standard economic models. These findings hold even in the most conservative households.</p>

                Monopsony with Insurance

                <p>Empirical evidence of monopsony power is often identified using firm wage and labor responses to shocks yet interpreted through static models which assume spot wages. This approach overlooks that wage insurance also affects wage and labor responses. To disentangle these two forces, we develop a general equilibrium dynamic monopsony model where firms contract with risk-averse workers over idiosyncratic shocks. Worker risk aversion can produce a more inelastic shock-identified labor supply elasticity without implying wider wage markdowns. To identify the model, we leverage the fact that while increasing risk aversion and reducing labor market competition both mute the wage pass-through, only risk aversion smooths the wage response over time. We estimate the model using U.S. Census employer-employee matched data and show that risk aversion is necessary to match the relatively small and persistent wage response to temporary shocks. We find the average worker's wage is marked down 8.3%—narrower than the typical 15%-50% range—and that workers exhibit considerable risk aversion. In addition to affecting our estimates of the markdown, insurance distorts the job ladder, preventing productivity-improving job transitions from occurring.</p>

                <p>Inversions—in which the popular vote winner loses the election—have occurred in four US presidential races. We show that rather than being statistical flukes, inversions have been ex ante likely since the early 1800s. In elections yielding a popular vote margin within 1 point (one-eighth of presidential elections), about 40 percent will be inversions in expectation. We show this conditional probability is remarkably stable across historical periods—despite differences in which groups voted, which states existed, and which parties participated. Our findings imply that the United States has experienced so few inversions merely because there have been so few elections (and fewer close elections).</p>
